Supervised Learning"></a>1. <strong>Supervised Learning</strong></h3><p>In supervised learning, the model learns using <strong>labeled data</strong> (data that already has answers).  </p><ul><li>Think of it like teaching a student with an answer key.  </li><li>Example:  <ul><li>Input: Photos of animals with labels (cat, dog).  </li><li>Task: The model learns to predict whether a new photo is a cat or a dog.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="2-Unsupervised-Learning"><a href="#2-Unsupervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="2. Unsupervised Learning"></a>2. <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong></h3><p>In unsupervised learning, the model works with <strong>unlabeled data</strong> (no answers provided). It identifies patterns or groups by itself.  </p><ul><li>Think of it like finding groups of friends in a crowd without knowing their names.  </li><li>Example: Grouping customers into different categories based on their purchase habits.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="🧠-What-is-Deep-Learning"><a href="#🧠-What-is-Deep-Learning" class="headerlink" title="🧠 What is Deep Learning?"></a>🧠 What is <strong>Deep Learning</strong>?</h2><p>Deep Learning is a <strong>subset of Machine Learning</strong> inspired by the structure of the human brain, using <strong>neural networks</strong>.  </p><ul><li>It is used for complex tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and playing games.  </li><li>Example: Deep Learning helps machines understand images to identify objects like faces, cars, or animals.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="🎮-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning"><a href="#🎮-What-is-Reinforcement-Learning" class="headerlink" title="🎮 What is Reinforcement Learning?"></a>🎮 What is <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>?</h2><p>Reinforcement Learning is a learning process where an agent (like a robot or AI program) learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving <strong>rewards</strong> or <strong>penalties</strong>.  </p><ul><li>Think of it like training a dog: Good behavior gets treats (rewards), and bad behavior gets no treats.  </li><li>Example: AI playing chess and learning strategies by trying different moves and improving based on wins or losses.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="🚀-Summary"><a href="#🚀-Summary" class="headerlink" title="🚀 Summary"></a>🚀 Summary</h2><ul><li><strong>AI</strong>: Makes machines mimic human intelligence.  </li><li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: A part of AI where machines learn from data.  <ul><li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Learning from labeled data.  </li><li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Learning patterns without labeled data.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: A more advanced ML using neural networks for complex tasks.  </li><li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Learning through rewards and penalties by interacting with an environment.</li></ul><p>With these tools, AI is transforming our world, making it smarter and more efficient! 🌍✨</p>]]></content>
